# BISON

This repository describes the **BISON** framework (*Blockchain Interpretable Success prediction for SOcial media NFTs*), which leverages linguistic statistics and blockchain-derived features to model and explain the success of blockchain-native articles (e.g., writing NFTs).

# Feature Description 
Below are the features used in the model, categorized by type. These features are used in a "multimodal", explainable ML pipeline to predict and interpret success on decentralized content platforms.

## Readability Indices & Linguistic Statistics

These features are extracted from the textual content of articles:

### Readability Metrics (3)

- `Kincaid Grade Level`: U.S. grade level required to understand the text.  
- `Flesch Reading Ease`: Score from 0â€“100; higher means easier.  
- `Gunning Fog Index`: Years of formal education required.  

### Statistical Linguistic Features (13)

- `characters_per_word`: Average characters per word  
- `syll_per_word`: Average syllables per word  
- `words_per_sentence`: Average words per sentence  
- `sentences_per_paragraph`: Average sentences per paragraph  
- `type_token_ratio`: Lexical diversity (% of unique word types over total tokens)  
- `characters`: Total character count  
- `syllables`: Total syllable count  
- `words`: Number of content tokens  
- `wordtypes`: Number of unique content word types  
- `sentences`: Total sentence count  
- `paragraphs`: Total paragraph count  
- `long_words`: Words with more than 6 letters

- `cleaned_text_lemmatized`: Lemmatized tokens (base forms of words)  
- `cleaned_text_POS`: Part-of-speech tagging of tokens  
- `cleaned_text_sentiment`: Sentiment score derived from text  
- `words_body`: Word count in the article body  
- `words_title`: Word count in the title  
- `words_text`: Total word count combining title and body  
- `normalized_tfidf_sum`: Normalized sum of TF-IDF scores across document  
- `verbs_density`: Density of verbs in text  
- `adjectives_density`: Density of adjectives in text  
- `nouns_density`: Density of nouns in text

## Topic-Related (8)

Thematic topics extracted from articles:

- `topic`: (categorical)  Represents the main topic of the article. Possible values are: T1: Gaming, Virtual Worlds & Characters; T2: Wallets, Airdrops & Ethereum Tools; T3: Web3, Blockchain & Digital Platforms; T4: DeFi, Market Strategies & Liquidity; T5: Blockchain, Transactions & Smart Contracts; T6: Web3 Launches, Rewards & Creators; T7: Human Thoughts, Emotions & Reflections.
- `topic_T1: Gaming, Virtual Worlds & Characters`

### Temporal (7)

- `days_since_epoch`: Days elapsed since article publication
- `publication_date`: Full publication date of the article or NFT in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `year_month`: Publication date grouped by year and month in `YYYY-MM` format, useful for temporal aggregation.
- `year`: Year of publication
